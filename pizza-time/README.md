### Recipes (or Pizza Time)
This is a ~~simple recipe page~~ very hard for me project. It's a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) course.

[Live Demo](https://lukasdevit.github.io/odin-project/pizza-time)

#### Asignment
- Create a index page with a list of recipes.

- Create three pages with recipes.

- Each recipe page should encompass an image, a concise description, a list of ingredients, and clear instructions.

Initially, this project seemed straightforward, but inspiration struck as I observed the innovative solutions of my fellow learners. Examples like [this ](https://tylphe.github.io/odin-recipes/recipe/chargercableholder.html) and [this ](https://tukoor.github.io/odin-recipes/) pushed me to think beyond the basics. While I'm not a coding wizard, my thirst for knowledge and the pursuit of excellence compelled me to take it up a notch.

I'm not content with just being a beginner; I strive to master the art of code. So, I set out to transform this project into something extraordinary. After studying other solutions, I made a crucial decision: my creation should not only be interactive but also entertaining, akin to the curious fact that pi is irrational, yet people keep trying to fit it into neat fractions.

#### My Creative Process

My culinary musings led me to one conclusion: pizza captures people's hearts like no other cuisine. But I didn't want to create a run-of-the-mill pizza recipe. Instead, I had an exciting idea tucked away in my mind. Considering my love for pizza, why not turn this project into a web-based game? Imagine running your own virtual pizzeria, taking orders, and crafting pizzas using your mouse. What if you could order a pizza you've custom-made in your web browser?

While this idea might not be groundbreaking, I'm eager to bring it to life. It doesn't strictly align with the assignment's guidelines, but here's a compromise: once you've created your virtual pizza masterpiece, you'll receive a real recipe to recreate your digital culinary creation. Sounds like a fun deal, doesn't it?

Now, let's get started and turn this project into something extraordinary!

#### Oh my god, where do I start?

 - Step 1: Create HTML!
 - Step 2: Learn canvas!
